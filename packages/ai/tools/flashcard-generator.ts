Guidelines:
- Keep questions and answers brief but clear (max 2-3 sentences each)
- Focus on one key concept per card
- Use simple, direct language
- Include a mnemonic or memory aid when helpful
- Highlight the most important takeaway
- Consider the user's context: ${context || "general learning"}

For each card:
1. Write a clear, focused question
2. Provide a concise, direct answer
3. Add a short mnemonic if it helps memory
4. Include one key takeaway point
5. Use relevant tags for organization

Remember:
- Quality over quantity
- Clarity over complexity
- Focus on essential information
- Make it easy to remember`
